My contribution to [cHaLkdusT](https://github.com/cHaLkdusT)'s repo.

# About
Find this to be the appropriate way to give my tribute to the Main main: Sir Jo. Looking back at my university days, when you were my Web technologies and Programming Applications instructor I have learned a lot, specially relevant sa career ko ngayon. Mga bagay na nagagamit ko day to day  like Unit testing, JavaScript+HTML+CSS, HTTP, Build tools, source control (git, subversion), ikaw Sir Jo nag introduce. Naalala ko nun may activity din na need ko magsearch ng opensource tech, so napacreate ako ng Github account ko (lol). Your legacy will last forever Sir, through your teachings and lessons to me na mapapasa ko pa sa iba sa hinaharap.
